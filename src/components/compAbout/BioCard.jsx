            <p>
            I'm a 16-year-old developer focused on building clean, 
            responsive, and user-friendly frontend interfaces using HTML, 
            CSS, JavaScript, and React. I turn ideas into functional, 
            visually appealing websites that perform smoothly across all devices.            
            </p>
            <p>
            While I currently specialize in frontend development, 
            I'm actively learning backend technologies to expand my 
            skills toward full-stack development in the future. 
            If you're looking for a reliable 
            developer to bring your website or web app to life, I'm ready to help.
